### Group Members
- Jacob
- Eleanor
- Kah Shin

### General Approach
1. Project collaboration document set up to determine:
   - User Stories
   - Wireframes
   - Responsibilities
   - General structure and naming conventions
2. Backend and Frontend split into 3 parts. Each member worked on one part from Frontend and Backend respectively to have development experience for fullstack.
3.  Work on backend commenced first, and built fully as a RESTful API with full CRUD for all the models.
4.  Frontend started once backend completed with Material UI framework.

### Technologies Used
  **MERN**
- **M:** MongoDB is a noSQL based database that stores information in JSON files that are actually JavaScript objects. It is non-relational and is very flexible as objects are not required to have the same properties to be stored in the same collection (table equivalent).
- **E:** Express is a framework that makes building a backend with Node.js extremely fast and flexible. Express cuts the time of setting up a local development server and allows the developer to get started on RESTful APIs with minimal fuss. 
- **R:** React.js is a popular JavaScript based frontend framework that helps to simplify the building of websites by breaking down the logic and functionality into smaller components. This makes projects more reusable, modular, and dynamic. 
- **N:** Node.js is one of the most popular server-side languages that is actually JavaScript. It allows JS to be run at the backend. Node allows the setting up of a server, while Express runs inside Node and makes CRUD HTTP requests straightforward.
